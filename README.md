# Tradingview Futu Python Bot Setup

The setup aims to use Tradingview alert function to do trade. There are a lot of tutorial in Youtube for using Internet Brokers but not for Futu. The webhook can detect the trading position through the previous and current trading position from Tradingview message. The position size depends on Tradingview message too. Thus please edit the Python script on your own logic.
